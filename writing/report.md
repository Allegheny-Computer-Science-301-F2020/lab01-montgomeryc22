### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - When big data meets dataveillance: the hidden side of analytics

-  Reference or article citation.
 - https://doi.org/10.24908/ss.v12i2.5113

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - This article focuses on the definition and breakdown of the term "dataveillance".

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - Dataveillance monitors a person's movement on the internet and makes suggestions and
 assumptions to appeal more to the user. The concern for me is a lack of privacy for the user.
 Its similar to being tracked virtually. People can know your every move and deduct how you behave
 or who you are from that.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The author includes a number of examples of dataveillance, however one that sticks out to me the most
 is the shopping aspect of dataveillance. When you look up something on the internet that you want to buy
 you'll notice if you go to a different website, they'll be ads of the item you were looking for or other
 items that are similar to the item you initially were looking for.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - Your answer here

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Both the users and "Big Data". As previously explained, the users loses their sense
 of privacy. They feel exposed and tracked. Whereas, Big Data gains are.. your data.
 Using your data against you is a marketing tool to get you to buy things you don't want.
 The more successful dataveillance is, the more companies are looking into it, and the more
 they look into it, the more money they're going to make.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 - Smarter fraud investigations with big data analytics

-  Reference or article citation.
 - https://doi.org/10.1016/S1353-4858(13)70135-1

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - This article talks about the inclination of fraudulent crimes and police's stance
 against it.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - Police force and private organizations using data in order to catch frauds.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Personal assets such as: bank statements, PDF files, emails, invoices and spreadsheets, etc.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - So I'm conflicted on how I feel about this because it is important to stop frauds
 from happening to try to eliminate them, however, again, there's no privacy for
 everyday townspeople; however, if there is fraud detected, you have to give your
 information in order to protect your identity.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The police and the investigators gain by stopping the fraud and victims tend to gain
 and lose. Gain because their accounts are now safe, but lose because they were attacked
 in the first place.
